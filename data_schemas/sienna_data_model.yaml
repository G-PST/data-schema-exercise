# Data Schema Sheet — Sienna Data Model
# ============================================================================
# Please fill out this sheet to describe your data schema / data model.
# This will be used for cross-project comparison at the G-PST workshop on
# power system planning interoperability.
#
# Instructions:
#   - Replace placeholder text (in angle brackets) with your information.
#   - Use ~ (null) for fields that don't apply.
#   - Use lists (- item) for multi-value fields. Please add entries as needed.
#   - Keep descriptions concise but specific.
#   - You do NOT need to detail things we can find in your repo (CI setup,
#     library dependencies, serialization formats, etc.). Just point us to
#     the code and we'll review it.

# 2. What It Is & What It Covers
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
summary:
  description: |
    <A paragraph describing what this data schema is, what problem it solves,
    and who the intended users are.>

  modeling_domains_supported: |
    <What modeling domains does this data schema support? e.g., capacity expansion
    (zonal), production cost (nodal), bulk power flow, dynamics, distribution,
    multi-energy/sector coupling, etc.>

  what_does_it_NOT_cover: |
    <Equally important — what is explicitly out of scope?>

  data_captured: |
    <What types of information? e.g., grid topology, device parameters,
    time series, investment costs, operating constraints, etc.>

  conceptual_structure: |
    <Is it component-based, bus-based, graph-based, relational,
    entity-relationship, hierarchical objects, etc.?>

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Key Design Decisions
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
design:
  key_decisions:
    - decision: <What did you decide?>
      rationale: <Why?>
    - decision: <...>
      rationale: <...>

  schema_format: |
    <e.g., Pydantic models, Julia structs, JSON Schema, Protocol Buffers,
    XML, CIM, custom DSL, other?>

  implementation_languages:
    - <e.g., Python>
    - <e.g., Julia>

  database_storage_backend: <e.g., PostgreSQL, file-based, in-memory only, ~>

  interoperability:
    imports_from:
      - <e.g., reads OpenDSS files>
      - <e.g., reads CIM XML>
    exports_to:
      - <e.g., exports to PowerSystems.jl>
      - <e.g., exports CIM XML>

  data_tool_relation: <Data only | Some tool specific | Tightly coupled>

  extensibility: |
    <How is the schema extended? e.g., plugin system, subclassing,
    open-ended fields, config-driven, fork-and-modify?>

  units_handling: |
    <How are units handled? e.g., implicit SI, explicit per-field,
    unit conversion library, embedded in field names?>

  validation_approach: |
    <What does validation cover? e.g., schema structure only, range checks,
    cross-field validation, physical consistency checks (e.g., convexity)?>

  governance: |
    <Who decides what to include and when to accept changes? e.g., single
    maintainer, core team with RFC process, community PRs with review?>

# 4. Real-World Usage
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage:
  tools_built_on_schema:
    - tool: <e.g., PowerSimulations.jl>
      relationship: <e.g., Uses schema as standard input format>
      link: <https://github.com/...>

  largest_real_world_dataset: |
    <Describe the most complex real-world dataset successfully represented
    in your schema — system size, model type, data source, what was tested.>

  who_is_using_it:
    - <e.g., "NREL for ReEDS-to-Sienna production cost studies">
    - <...>

  data_available:
    - geographic_area: <e.g., US Western Interconnect>
      content: |
        <e.g., power flow only, investment cost data, unit commitment
        constraints on generators, load profiles only, etc.>
      access: <public | ceii_or_nda | licensed | proprietary>

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Limitations & Challenges
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
challenges:
  known_limitations:
    - <e.g., "No native support for sector coupling / multi-carrier">
    - <...>

  hardest_problems_encountered: |
    <What has been the most difficult technical challenge in developing
    or using this data schema? What did you learn?>

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Interoperability & Convergence
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
interoperability:
  areas_of_overlap_with_other_schemas: |
    <If you're familiar with any of the other data schemas in this comparison,
    note specific areas where your approaches overlap or diverge.>

  what_would_convergence_require: |
    <What would it take for you to align with or contribute to other data schemas if an
    interoperability-focused tool like a translator adopted a data schema as its core schema layer?
    What from your approach should still be incorporated?>

  biggest_thing_others_should_know: |
    <What is the single most important thing — positive or cautionary —
    that others should understand about your data schema?>
